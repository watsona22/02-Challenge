# 02-Challenge

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to deploy a working Horiseon webpage with concise, semantic elements in the supporting HTML and CSS files. 

The acceptance criteria were as follows: 
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

All acceptance criteria have been met and the site functions as expected. There are also acceptability features added in the form of alt text. 

I learned that semantic elements are preferred to non-semantic and that they should be organized in a way that makes sense to future readers. Furthermore becuase the location of my files changed, I had to redirect file paths for images in the html and css style sheet. With the perspective of hindsight, I now know how to approach problems methodically and what kinds of things to look for. 

## Usage

The html and css file can be used to view the company website with web accessibility considerations applied. A link to the mockup is accessible from the repository file list.
